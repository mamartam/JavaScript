In JavaScript, loops allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a 
specified condition is true.
A loop is a way to repeat the same code several times.

Common loops in JS:
1. for
2. for in
3. for of
4. do while
5. while
6. break & continue
7. forEach(method)

One execution of the loop is called an iteration.
!!! Break and continue cannot be used with a ternary operator!!!
